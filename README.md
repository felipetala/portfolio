- The IEEE labeled projects were led by undergrad and grad team leads. I assisted them with anything they needed as a project director (schematic drafts, teaching freshmenÂ good troubleshooting practices, ordering parts, etc.).

- The memristor ternary device is a work in progress. Been thinking of using memristors to make a circadian clock, but I am still working on the details - feel free to share any ideas on this.

- Regarding projects for my use, I started to work on a phone use restriction box. The goal is to develop the habit of stopping screen usage 2 hs before sleep, and stopping phone noise and communication signals from disrupting sleep.
