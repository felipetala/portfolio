- The IEEE labeled projects were led by undergrad and grad team leads. I assisted them with anything they needed as a project director (schematic drafts, teaching freshmen good troubleshooting practices, ordering parts, etc.).

- The memristor ternary device is a work in progress. I should be done with the design by the end of this week, to be able to order the PCB and construct an improved version here. Been thinking of using memristors to make a circadian clock, but I am still working on the details - feel free to share any ideas on this.

- Additionally, I started to work on an old idea for a phone use restriction box - this falls more into your question of making projects for myself. The goal is to develop the habit of stopping screen usage 2 hs before sleep. I'll give you updates if you find it interesting.
